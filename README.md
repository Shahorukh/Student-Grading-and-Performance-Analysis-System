# Student-Grading-and-Performance-Analysis-System

Project Title: "Student Grading and Performance Analysis System" ( shahorukh khan )
Objective
Develop a Python application to manage student records, calculate grades, and analyze class performance using core Python concepts such as data structures, file handling, conditional statements, and loops.

Project Tasks
1. Data Initialization
Create a CSV file to store initial student data with the following fields:
Student ID, Name, Subjects (e.g., Math, English, Science), Marks, Grade.
Store the data in Python data structures like lists or dictionaries for processing.

2. Student Record Management
Allow the user to:
Add new students with marks for each subject.
Update marks or details of existing students.
Remove a student record by their ID.

3. Grade Calculation
Use conditional statements to calculate grades based on marks:
Example:
90-100: A
80-89: B
70-79: C
<70: F
Assign grades for all students and update the dataset.

5. Searching and Filtering
Provide the following options:
Search for a student by their ID or name.
Filter students based on grades (e.g., all students with grade "A").
Show a list of students who failed in any subject.

6. User Interaction
Build a menu-driven program with the following options:
Add, update, or delete a student record.
View a class performance summary (average marks, top/low scorer, pass percentage).
Search and filter student records.
